----------------

- Update translations and translate folder_listing.
  [thet]

- Add z3c.autoinclude.plugin entry point.
  [thet]


1.5 (2012-11-30)
----------------

- Let the folderish types derive from Products.ATContentTypes ATFolder instead
  of plone.app.folder's implementation. It inherits some i18n classes. This
  fixes the issue that on translation of folderish types LinguaPlone's
  translation view wasn't shown.
  [thet]


1.4 (2012-11-28)
----------------
